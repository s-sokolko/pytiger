# pytiger

Motivation
There are so many companies all over the world, who are used to the good old vTiger. But what’s really disappointing is the fact that it is written in PHP, using prehistoric pearDB, bootstrap 2 and stuff like that. But the good thing is that the UI of vTiger is awesome. It’s so simple and logical, that people can start using it in no time. So we want our own vTiger (with blackjack and hookers) written in the new shiny Python3 with almost the same UI logic.
